Comparision Operators
# = is an assignment operator, e.g., a = b assigns a with the value of b;
# == is the question are these values equal? so a == b compares a and b.
# It is a binary operator with left-sided binding. It needs two arguments and checks if they are equal.
2 == 2
True
# The integer 2 is implicitly converted to a floating-point number, resulting in 2..
# The comparison 2. == 2. is now between two floating-point numbers of the same value.
2 == 2.
True
1 == 2
False
var = 0 #Assain 0 to var
print(var == 0)
True
var = 1 #Asssain 1 to var
print(var == 1)
True
var = 0 #Assain o to var
print(var != 0)
False
var = 1 #ASSAIN 1 to var
print(var != 1)
False
# Greater than or equal to
centigrade_outside >= 0.0  
current_velocity_mph < 85  # Less than
current_velocity_mph <= 85  # Less than or equal to
